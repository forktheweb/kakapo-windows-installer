# kakapo-windows-installer

the kakapo sound generator, as an electron app with installation tool.

I've compiled Kakapo from an E2E elecron app into a native windows installer (exe) build, using NodeJS and several other tools.

Here's the executable binary.  It's all you need to install the program.  I've also uploaded the native electron app, for reference.
